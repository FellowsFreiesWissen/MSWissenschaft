# MSWissenschaft

A contribution from Wikimedia Germany to the traveling science exhibition on board the riverboat MS Wissenschaft, as per https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:GLAM/Ship .

The basic idea is to display the route of the boat on a clickable and zoomable map that will display information about a selection of geolocated articles on the German Wikipedia. The map is complemented by a clickable timeline that will predefine the settings of the map as a function of the position of the boat over time.
